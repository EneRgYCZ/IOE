# Gomibo-IOE Development

## General Procedure
- Tasks are added to the backlog
- Tasks are assigned to one or more team members
- Tasks are converted to issues
- Branches are made from assigned issues
- Code is written locally and committed to the branch
- Pull Request is made when the task is finished
- 2 approvals are needed to merge to main
- Approved PRs are squashed and merged (all commits are squashed into one commit per PR)
Note: The last step was sometimes omitted. The number of commits per person in the main branch do not reflect the actual amount of commits the person made.
